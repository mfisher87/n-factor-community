ðŸš§ This is a work in progress. ðŸš§

I'd love to hear your ideas! Please open an issue, pull request, or start a discussion

:::

This is an early-stage idea based on the [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/),
which aims to provide software developers with a checklist to guide robust application
development.

We need something similar for community development/engagement. I'm coming at this from
the perspective of open science communities, but this could be a general resource for
any open technical community.
